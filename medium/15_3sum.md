# 3 Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

## Solution: Two Pointers
### Language: Python3
### Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Two pointers approach can be used to find 2 indices whose sum equals to specific values. 
In this solution, we take take the first value out and solve the problem by finding the 2 values that sum up to 0.
In other words, we loop through each number in the sorted list, let the number be nums[i] and use the two-pointers technique to find the other 2 values such that nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r] == 0.
We also have to increment or decrement two pointers when the value is the same as the previous one.

```python3
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        ret = []
        for i in range(n):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]: continue 
            l, r = i + 1, n - 1
            while l < r:
                sum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if sum < 0:
                    l += 1
                elif sum > 0:
                    r -= 1
                else:
                    ret.append([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]])
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1
                    while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l - 1]:
                        l += 1
                    while l < r and nums[r] == nums[r + 1]:
                        r -= 1
        return ret
```
